NSO SYSLOG RELAY
================

This example shows how to configure NSO and a syslog daemon to relay
messages over the network. This configuration can be used to send the
various NSO logs over the network to another syslog server or a third
party product which consumes the syslog messages.


Dependencies
------------
The example need the following software

    netcat
    rsyslog OR syslogd from inet-utils

By default rsyslog is used by Debian, Ubuntu, and RHEL.


Configuration
-------------
This example includes configuration for NSO and syslog to relay
messages.

* NSO is configured to use the local syslog daemon with facility
  "local0". The NCS and audit logs are configured to log to syslog.

* The rsyslog configuration files included listens on 127.0.0.1:20514
  for respective protocol.


The configuration files are as follows:

    ncs.conf
    rsyslog.udp.conf
    rsyslog.tcp.conf
    rsyslog.relp.conf

The configuration for inet-utils' syslogd is similar to rsyslog, and
both the UDP and TCP configurations should be possible to use as is.


Run the example
---------------
The following example will use TCP for transport. If another transport
is wanted, replace the transport everywhere applicable in commands
below. Note that the RELP protocol needs a configured rsyslog on the
other end to work.

Setup the example by executing

    $ make build

This will setup an ncs directory with the included ncs.conf.

Configure e.g. rsyslog by copying one of the syslog.*.conf files in
/etc/rsyslog.d and then reload the configuration

    $ sudo cp syslog.tcp.conf /etc/rsyslog.d
    $ sudo systemctl restart rsyslog.service

Verify that the syslog configuration works, run the syslog listener on
the preconfigured port (20514) in one terminal

    $ make syslog-tcp-listener

In another terminal, log something to our syslog facility

    logger --priority local0.info "tis but a scratch"

In the terminal with the syslog listener a similar message should appear

    <134>Nov 25 11:04:34 prometheus avtobiff: tis but a scratch

Next start NSO, the syslog listener terminal should fill up with
messages

    $ make start

Trigger an audit log request through e.g. CLI or RESTCONF

    $ make cli
    $ curl -isu admin:admin http://localhost:8080/restconf

Both commands above should yield audit log messages being sent to the
syslog listener.


Considerations
--------------
Remember that firewalls might need to allow connections in order for this
example to work.

Third party products may need to be configured separately to consume
syslog messages. This is outside the scope of this example.


This concludes the example on how to setup NSO together with a syslog
daemon to relay syslog messages over the network.
